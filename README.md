# Connect Four Game

Welcome to the Connect Four game implementation in C++!

## Introduction

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.
